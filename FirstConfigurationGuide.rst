=========================
First Configuration Guide
=========================

You have just installed your GlobaLeaks and you have to make it capable of receiving anonymous submissions that get dispatched to configured recipients. To achieve this you have to access to the Platform Wizard.


STEP 1: Access Platform Wizard
-------------------------------

You can reach the Platform Wizard by your browser in two ways:


  - from the same computer you installed GlobaLeaks on: http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/wizard

  - from your Tor Hidden Service hostname with Tor Browser: Example: http://2rwejhgkn3c2z56g.onion/#/wizard


(You can find the onion address of your GlobaLeaks installation in /var/globaleaks/log/globaleaks.log some minutes after globaleaks has been launched after the successful ending of the install script)

Note that loading the interface may take a while, due to the High Latency of Tor Hidden Service


This will bring you to the page for "Step-by-step setup"
